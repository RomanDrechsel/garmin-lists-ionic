<h2>2. General Information</h2>
<p>This privacy policy explains the nature, scope, and purpose of the collection and use of personal data by the app "Lists". I take the protection of your personal data very seriously and strictly adhere to the rules of data protection laws.</p>

<h2>3. Data Collection and Processing</h2>
<h3>3.1. No Collection of Personal Data</h3>
<p>My app does not collect personal data from users. All data entered is stored exclusively on the user's device. There is no storage or processing of this data on my servers.</p>
<h3>3.2. Data Storage in Google Cloud</h3>
<p>
    If the user enables a backup of their data, the data will be stored in Google Cloud. This only occurs if the user explicitly activates this feature in the app settings. Google's privacy policies can be found at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.<br />
    The responsibility for data security in Google Cloud lies with Google.

<h3>3.3. Data Transfer to Garmin Devices</h3>
<p>The data you enter is also transferred to connected Garmin watches via Bluetooth using the Garmin ConnectIQ API as part of the app usage. This data transfer occurs solely between your smartphone and the Garmin watch and is not stored or processed on my servers.</p>

<h2>Use of AdMob</h2>

<h3>4.1. General</h3>

    <li>Unique identifiers (e.g., advertising ID)</li>
    <li>IP address</li>
    <li>Location information</li>
</ul>

<h3>4.3. Purpose of Data Processing by AdMob</h3>

    <li>Manage your ad settings, delete your advertising ID, or request data deletion following Google's instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that as a developer, I do not have direct access to the data collected by AdMob and therefore cannot initiate the deletion of this data. For further assistance, you can contact <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/" target="_blank">AdMob Support</a>.</p>
